``CC``
  Since ``mailman`` apparently `sometimes trims list members
  <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-developers/2002-September/013233.html>`_
  from the ``CC`` header to avoid sending duplicates. Which means that copies of mail
  reflected back from the list server will have a different ``CC`` to the copy saved by
  the MUA at send-time.

``BCC``
  Because copies of the mail saved by the MUA at send-time will have ``BCC``, but copies
  reflected back from the list server won't.

``Reply-To``
  Since a mail could be ``CC``'d to two lists with different ``Reply-To`` munging
  options set.

Since we're ignoring the ``Content-Length`` header by default `because of mailing-list
effects <https://kdeldycke.github.io/mail-deduplicate/design.html#mailing-lists>`_, we
introduced a limit on the allowed difference between the sizes of the message payloads.

If this is exceeded, a warning is issued and the messages are not considered duplicates,
because this could point to message corruption somewhere, or a false positive.

.. note::
    Headers are not counted towards this threshold, because many `headers can be added
    by mailing list software
    <https://kdeldycke.github.io/mail-deduplicate/design.html#mailing-lists>`_ such as
    ``mailman``, or even by the process of sending the mail through various MTAs.

    One copy could have been stored by the sender's MUA prior to sending, without any
    ``Received`` headers, and another copy could be reflected back via a ``CC``-to-self
