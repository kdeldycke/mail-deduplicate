# {octicon}`log` History

This script was [initially released in 2010](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2010/maildir-deduplication-script-python/), and was living in a [messy GitHub repository](https://github.com/kdeldycke/scripts).

After some years, the script basically outgrew its initial intent, and [moved in 2013 to its own repository](https://kevin.deldycke.com/2013/maildir-deduplicate-moved/).

It then continued to be updated as a stand-alone script before being properly packaged into the current form. The last known working version of the stand-alone script is available in the [legacy branch](https://github.com/kdeldycke/mail-deduplicate/tree/legacy).

The project lived under the name `maildir-deduplicate` from 2014 to 2020. It was renamed to `mail-deduplicate` in 2020 following the addition of `mbox` support alongside `maildir` sources.
